# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the inner workings of this demo.

# Project Initialization from Scratch

If you want to recreate this demo from scratch, the following steps have to be done.

![image info](./images/project_initialization_from_scratch_1.png)

From the nRF Connect Extension (1) please select the "Welcome" section (2) and choose to "Open Welcome Page" (3).

Afterwards chosse "Create a new application from sample..." (4) .

![image info](./images/project_initialization_from_scratch_2.png)

The goal is to create a freestanding (1) application, which runs as part of the installed nRF Connect SDK.

Application location (2) and application name (2) can be freely chosen, for example "act-pan1781-sn-gcja5". All other settings are predefined and should already be set correctly.

The application template (4) must be set to the "hello_world" demo from the nRF Connect SDK - use the "Browse..." button to search for it.

Afterwards select "Create Application" to continue.

Now a build configuration has to be created as explained in the README.

# Adaptations

## Project Configuration

![image info](./images/project_configuration.png)

A couple of options are enabled and configured in prj.conf (1) in addition to the ones that are already set in the "hello world" example.

### Bluetooth

All options starting with CONFIG_BT enable general Bluetooth support and peripheral support  for the application. For personalization the device name and the appearance are set. Some Bluetooth-internal buffers are increased to support a larger MTU size for a more efficient data transfer.

### Nordic UART Service

The CONFIG_BT_NUS options enables support for the Nordic UART Service (NUS).

### Logging

Various options enable logging. The output of the logging is re-routed to the Segger J-Link RTT backend instead of the serial UART console. Also support for the console is enabled and re-routed to the Segger J-Link RTT backend. Assertions are enabled, so that run-time errors are caught easily.

### I2C

The CONFIG_I2C option enables general I2C support.

## Main Code

![image info](./images/main_code.png)

The code as present in main.c (1) can be divided into separate blocks.

### Bluetooth Handling

The code must keep track of the connection state and if the Nordic UART service is enabled, so appropriate callback functions are provided and the states are tracked in global variables.

### Sensor Handling

First a bunch of helper functions to access the registers of the sensor are provided, followed by an init() function.

Afterwards the main sensor process function reads out all sensor values by using some helper macros, crafts a message that contains all sensor values in a human-readable form and finally sends them out using the Nordic UART service.

### Main Function

First the main function initializes the sensor, Bluetooth and Nordic UART subsystems.

After starting the advertising it goes into an endless loop and checks every second if a connection has been established and sending via the Nordic UART service is possible and if so, the sensor processing function is called to transfer sensor data to the connected device.

# Troubleshooting

## Problems with Visual Studio Code

### Build Output Does Not Show In Terminal Window

Sometimes the build output is only shown in the small window in the lower right corner, but the terminal windows is overlaid by some other terminal window. Solution: Close the other terminal windows.

### Jumping To Compile Error Does Not Work

Clicking on the error output does not open the offending code right away. Solution: press CTRL and click on the file name in the output.
